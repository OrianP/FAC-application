        <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>I was born and raised in Israel by a psychiatrist father and flamenco dancer mother. My native language is Hebrew. When I was 7-years old, my parents gathered our belongings, my younger sibling and I, and the family moved to California for two years, where I learned to speak English. My mother sent me to dance classes from a young age, hoping I would take after her and become a dancer. I did not become a professional dancer, but I did catch the performing arts bug! I was drawn to theatre and music and participated in school productions. In high school, I chose to major in Theatre and Biology because, according to my high-school counsellor, you need to balance out all that art with a ‘real’ subject. </p>

            <p class="about-text">Nevertheless, I have been very privileged to have had support from my parents in pursuing a career in the arts. My mother and father never tried to discourage me. They never told me I should have a ‘plan B’.  This is quite unusual where I come from, especially since I am third generation to holocaust survivors. We, Israelis, have absorbed a generational trauma that drives us to pursue survival above all, and survival is choosing a stable profession. One so essential to society that it cannot be discriminated against: Doctor, Lawyer, Accountant etc. Arts are seen by most as no more than a hobby, and so it requires a leap of faith to support your child when they choose to make it a career. I appreciate that not everyone has had the opportunities and support that I have been very fortunate to receive. </p>

            <p class="about-text">After completing my mandatory two-year service as a commander in the Israeli Defence Force, and knowing that if I wanted to seriously pursue a career in music I needed to move to a country that had a serious music industry, I auditioned for a performing arts university in Liverpool and seized the opportunity when I got my acceptance letter. University is where I met my life partner. Since graduation, my partner and I have been working together: performing, writing and releasing music under the duo name O&O (His name is Obadiah, and we wanted to be like Simon & Garfunkel, hence the name). Initially, we performed on cruise ships for 4 to 6-month long contracts. At the time, my student visa had run out and I was not able to work in the UK, so the only way for us to stay together was at sea. After two years of ‘ship life’ and a lot of bureaucracy, I was granted a Romanian passport on the base of ancestry and we were able to move back to the UK. In September 2016, we landed in London. Since then, we have worked hard to establish ourselves in the music scene and make a living as self-employed musicians.  </p>

            <p class="about-text">When the UK lockdown began in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the live music industry was shut down and, like many others, I found myself out of work. I felt grateful that my family was safe and healthy and that I was healthy and able to pay my rent, but I was very worried about the future. Eager to make use of the extra free time on my hands, I signed up for two free online courses: Digital Marketing and Web Development. Marketing was ok…but web development was mind blowing! I could not believe that all you have to do is type some code and then magically the computer executes it. What!? Of course there is much more to it then that, but this was my first impression and I was very intrigued to learn more. </p>

            <p class="about-text">Before this, I never saw myself as the kind of person who has the ‘smarts’ to study coding. I went through an education system that drew a hard line between subjects like Math and Science and History and Arts. I was always in the ‘emotional intelligence’ camp: good with language-based, creative tasks. To say I struggled with Math in high school would be an understatement. I had this idea that you have to be good at math to become a web developer. When I started learning to code, I realised that it is actually about learning a <span class="italic">language</span> and often requires creative thinking. It also requires the kind of logical thinking that is intuitive for me: taking a problem or goal and breaking it down into a step-by-step plan. I feel excited to continue down this path of learning and see where it takes me.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Why am I Applying for FAC? </h2>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>I discovered FAC in January 2021. Whilst Googling a solution to a problem for a Codecademy project, I cam across this article written by FAC alumni, [name]. At the time, I was self-studying on Codecademy and Udemy for about 6 months and enjoying going at my own pace. However, I knew I wanted to eventually be part of a programme and learn with others and from others. I wanted to connect with other people who were in a similar position to mine: just getting into coding without a Computer Science degree or background. I also knew I wanted to learn from people who have real-life experience in the tech industry. Through friends, I connected with a drummer from Sydney who recently made the switch to web development  after completing a coding bootcamp in NYC. Our hour-long call was incredibly inspiring and motivating: I knew that I wanted to find the right programme for me. </p>

            <p>The word ‘Bootcamp’ in any context has never appealed to me. (Maybe because I went to an actual bootcamp when I was drafted to the IDF - a slightly traumatising event). I also don’t believe in quick fixes for anything in life. Certainly not when it comes to learning. Most of my music peers have dedicated their lives and thousands of hours of practice to eventually be able to perform effortlessly on stage and ‘make it look easy’. This is one of the reasons I connect with FAC’s ethos and appreciate that FAC does not make any ‘quick fix’ promises about learning everything in a short period of time. I sometimes get overwhelmed by how much I still don’t know. What I do know, is that I will never know <span class="italic">everything</span>. Instead, my goal is to keep learning every day and to keep an open mind-set - a willingness to learn new languages and technologies as they emerge and develop. </p>

            <p>I have been very lucky to be offered a spot on the FAC coaching programme and it has been an invaluable experience that I am <span class="italic">so</span> grateful for. The first time I brought a Kata to my small study group, I was nervous and a bit overwhelmed. Afterwards, I was beating myself up for ‘blanking’, not having good ideas on the spot, typing too slow… along with a whole host of other unhelpful self-criticisms. I questioned whether I would be suited for the group learning style. Over time, as the sessions continued, I felt a real connection building within the group and it became a safe environment to make mistakes and learn from them. I realised that learning to work in a team also takes practice, and that being able to understand a problem and think about it in the group environment is exactly the skill that I need to develop. </p>

            <p>Finally, I believe in FAC’s mission of inclusion and social impact. Increasingly, I think that learning about programming means getting a glimpse into how modern society functions. As algorithms are increasingly used to model our consumer behaviour, credit-worthiness, probability of committing offences etc., it is disturbing to realise that these models are built mostly by a small, homogenous portion of society and as a result, certain discriminations and judgements are trickling into the code, at times unbeknownst to those writing it. </p>
            <p>Watching the film <span class="italic"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394170/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coded Bias</a></span> and reading <span class="italic"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weapons of Math Destruction</a></span> by <span class="italic"><a href="https://mathbabe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cathy O'Neil</a></span> have been eye openers for me, and I need to keep learning about the issues they raise. Everyone has something to gain from the inclusion and representation of people from every spectrum of society and if this does not happen, the very human flaws of racism and prejudice will continue to be embedded in so-called ‘objective’ algorithms, leaving little room to question the decision-making logic behind them. That is quite scary. I may never be able to make a difference about this or contribute to improving one of these complex mathematical models, but at the very least I can educate myself about these topics, try to raise awareness and advocate for inclusion.</p>

                    <p>The last 7 years have been an incredible journey and I have learned a lot along the way. As I started self-studying web development and being involved in the FAC community, I noticed more and more overlap between the skills and attitudes required for learning music and those for learning web development. First, both require taking responsibility over your own learning. No one can force you to practice your instrument technique for hours (except your mom), and the same goes for practicing your programming technique: sitting down to solve a mind-bending Kata or to read a long article about a concept you are struggling to grasp. The learning is self-motivated and you have to do it consistently in order to make progress. </p>

                    <p>Effective communication and a positive attitude are also key to thriving as a musician - no one will want to book you for a gig if you are known to be a diva! In order to create music with others, you need to be able to articulate your ideas and present them in a way that inspires collaboration. I believe the same goes for any kind of team work and this is where I really connect with FAC’s group learning style. I have learned so much by talking about code and working with others to solve challenges. Being in the group environment has pushed me out of my comfort zone and as a result, accelerated my learning. </p>

                    <p>A few years ago, my partner and I started a YouTube channel together where we post video tutorials teaching viewers how to sing in harmony. Singing in harmony is when two or more people are singing different notes at the same time. The intervals between the notes create a sound that is pleasing to our ears. It is definitely a skill that requires practice! The videos we have created about this topic are aimed at complete beginners with little to no experience in music and no music theory knowledge. Writing the content for these tutorials requires explaining a theoretical concept and breaking it down into small, practical steps that anyone can understand and repeat. Through creating this content, I have gained a deeper understanding of these concepts and found that I really enjoy exploring the most effective ways to explain them! I find this process very similar to writing comments in code or talking aloud about code and explaining your logic to others. In our coaching program, I found it fascinating to play the roles of observer and respondent, trying to identify which questions could support a proposer on their way to solving a challenge. </p>

                    <p>Music and web development both share a ‘Do-It-Yourself’ attitude in the sense that, if you don’t know how to do something - you just figure it out (with a bit of Google magic)! As an independent artist in the music industry, I often took on many roles outside of the actual music-making. I have been my own PR agent, social media manager, video editor, artwork designer etc. When something needs doing, like booking a UK tour or shooting a music video, you just…find out how, make a plan and then do it! You teach yourself the extra skills that you need in order to make your idea a reality. What I love about programming, is the fact that you <span class="italic">can</span> find all the answers. Whatever feature you are trying to build or whatever error you run into, most likely someone else has been in the exact same position before and you can learn from their experience. It is so exciting to not have a clue about how to do something or how to solve a problem, and then a few hours/days/weeks later, to figure it out and do it! </p>
